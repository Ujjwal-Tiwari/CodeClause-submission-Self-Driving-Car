# Self-Driving Cars Object Detection

The Self-Driving Cars Object Detection project aims to enhance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles through advanced computer vision techniques. By enabling these vehicles to identify and track various objects on the road, such as bikers, pedestrians, cars, traffic lights, and trucks, they can navigate safely and efficiently.

## Overview

The project utilizes a dataset from the Udacity Self-Driving Car Challenge, which consists of 30,000 images and encompasses 11 classes of objects. This diverse dataset captures a wide range of scenarios and conditions, making it an excellent training set for the object detection model.

To train the object detection model, the project leverages Yolov8, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm specifically designed for object detection tasks. Yolov8 offers high efficiency and real-time image processing capabilities, making it well-suited for autonomous vehicle applications.

The trained model demonstrates accurate object detection and classification on the road. It can effectively identify various objects, including different types of traffic lights with distinct colors and subtypes (e.g., green left arrow, red left arrow), as well as trucks commonly used for transporting goods.

## Installation
